## Can you automate any repetitive tasks?

Often, computer tasks that need to be done over and over again by a human can be opportunities for error to sneak in. Setting up an automated way of running repetitive (and boring) tasks can eliminate this issue. Anything from a MS Excel formula or macro to coding in a data science frameword can help.

Let's think about the repetitive tasks that you could automate - do you always rename files the same way? Do you manually copy files across?

Ways you can automate things:
* Spreadsheet Macros and formulas - [Using macros in microsoft excel to facilitate cleaning of research data](https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2021.1954282) has instructions on how.
* MacOS - Automator [find out how to automate 10 useful things](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/11/21/cool-things-mac-automator-tutorial/)
* Win 10 - Task scheduler [learn how with this blog post](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-automated-task-using-task-scheduler-windows-10)
* [Microsoft Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-gb/) or [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/){% endcapture %}{% include card.html header="First steps" text=text %}
